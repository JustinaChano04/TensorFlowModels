# Custom linter for the TensorFlow team

This linter is built on top of the YAPF Python formatter. These are the style faux pas that this hopes to correct.

- bad-docstring-quotes (C0198)
- inconsistent-quotes (W1405)

## Try it out
Run the following command to lint the yolo directory
```
python3 linter yolo
```
